Running the Python programme QtTinySA on a fresh installation of Pi OS 12 'bookworm'.  Python3 is installed by default with the OS.

It is necessary to install 'python3-pyqtgraph' and 'python3-pyqt5.qtsql' using the package manager or at the command line:

sudo apt install python3-pyqtgraph
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5.qtsql

the following dependencies will probably already be installed as part of the standard OS:

sudo apt install python3-numpy
sudo apt install python3-opengl
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt install python3-serial

From the desktop, open a Terminal, cd to the QtTinySA directory and run the programme by entering

python3 QtTinySA.py

The 3D graph doesn't work across a X11 remote desktop session such as X2Go.  Not yet tested with WayVNC.
