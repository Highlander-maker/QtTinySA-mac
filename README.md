# QtTinySA
 
Erik, if you are reading this you can email me at ian.jefferson@btinternet.com

I wanted at programme that could control my new TinySA Ultra and run in Linux.  i am just a Python beginner.  There ios a lot more work to do before i make it public, but I will get there.

I would like your permission to call it "QtTinySA"
