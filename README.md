# QtTinySA  
![Main_screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1af2da-3308-49b1-b471-9c64c6d14ed3)

A Python 'TinySA Ultra' (and original 'TinySA') GUI programme using Qt5 and PyQt5. Designed to run in Linux but also works in mac (no testing)
and Windows.
  
For information on how to install it and how to use some of the features, see the Wiki pages.

The code attempts to replicate some of the TinySA Ultra on-screen commands on the PC.
Development and testing are now on Kubuntu 24.04LTS with Python 3.11.8 and PyQt5 using Spyder.

'TinySA', 'TinySA Ultra' and the TinySA icon are trademarks of Erik Kaashoek and are used with his permission.

TinySA commands are based on Erik's Python examples:

The serial communication commands are based on Martin's Python NanoVNA/TinySA Toolset

The GUI is now designed for a 1024 x 768 screen but should maximise properly.  The GUI appearence may change significantly due to development.
