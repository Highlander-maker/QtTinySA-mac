# QtTinySA

A Python TinySA Ultra GUI programme using Qt5 and PyQt5 designed to run in Linux.

This code attempts to replicate some of the TinySA Ultra on-screen commands and to provide PC control.
Development took place on Kubuntu 22.04LTS with Python 3.9 and PyQt5 using Spyder in Anaconda.
Not tested in any version of Windows.

'TinySA' and 'TinySA Ultra' are trademarks of Erik Kaashoek and are used with his permission.

TinySA commands are based on Erik's Python examples:

The serial communication commands are based on the Python NanoVNA/TinySA Toolset of Martin Ho-Ro:

The GUI is designed for a 7" 1024 x 600 screen but should maximise properly.  The GUI appearence may change significantly due to development.

Intended development in no particular order:

Markers.

More traces.

Error trapping.

Other ideas.

Generator control.

Time Spectrum (3D view of stored sweeps going back in time).
