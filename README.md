# QtTinySA
 
Erik, if you are reading this you can email me at ian.jefferson@btinternet.com

I wanted a GUI programme that could control my new TinySA Ultra and run in Linux.  I am just a Python beginner.  There is more work to do before I make it public, but I will get there soon.

I would like your permission to call it "QtTinySA"
